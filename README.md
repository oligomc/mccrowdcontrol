# MC Crowd Control (mccc)

## Description
Control a mob's ability to become aggrovated in hostile crowds or aggrovate the crowd around them. 

## Usage
Place a `golden_sword` with the custom enchantment `cc:independence` into a mob's mainhand to make them independent from their crowd. Applies to bees, wolves, and zombified piglin.

Quickly summon a crowd of mobs using `cc:summon/[entity]`, one will be generated as independent.

## Limitations
There is still a small chance for crowd mobs to become aggravated by an attacked independent mob, generally when their hitboxes partially overlap. Works best in low mob densities.
